# Calculator in C#
This simple application functions identically to any other calculator you would find on your phone or computer. The code uses a simple switch statement to tell the program which operator to use for the numbers entered when the = button is pressed. 

Each number outputs the number in a string format to the label box at the top and the program reads this text to determine the numbers used in the actual calculation.
